This are my AppleScripts that I install in the Scripts folder on every computer I use.

Install running the following commands.

```shell
cd ~/Library
mv Scripts Scripts_bak # back up old folder just in case
git clone https://github.com/bgebhardt/osx_scripts_folder.git
mv -i osx_scripts_folder Scripts
```
