Script ideas

# "Task" events scripts
1. script to move scheduled tasks events to the next day

[AppleScript: Moving an event to the next â€¦ - Apple Community](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5703499)

# Ability to sync calendar colors across machines, with google and with outlook

1. script to export calendar colors
2. script to import calendar colors

Unfortunatley there is no easy way to move an event from one calendar to nother, so I abandoned that idea.
